# Quiz 1: Nia’s Introduction 🌟
### Hi, I’m Nia! 🙂

I’m a senior studying Information Sciences and am interested in HCI and UX. I also have an interest in product management. I’m taking this course because I felt like it would be a good way to learn management skills that I haven't in previous courses.

### My Hobbies

Activity | Time |
------|------|
Figure Skating ⛸️ | I’ve been taking lessons on and off for 3 years. |
Dance 🩰 | I’ve done a combination of studio and team dance for 13 years. |
Trying New Restaurants 🍴 | Always, but especially now that it’s my last year on campus! |

Nice to meet you all! :)
