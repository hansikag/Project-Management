<h1>Hello!</h1>
<h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Say Say and I'm a junior studying Information Sciences. I transferred to UIUC last semester from a community college in my hometown. I'm currently pursing research for the Community Data Clinic and am looking forward to what else UIUC has to offer. In my free time I like to crochet and watch soccer. My day can be considered perfect if I'm able to do both of those things!</p>
<h2>Getting a Taste of Chambana</h2>
<p>Here are some restaurants I've visited since touching down in Champaign. There are so many more places to try!</p>
