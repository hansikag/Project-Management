# Madison Park 🌈

## a little look into the madness 🪣🔥

hello hello ~ I'm madison (sometimes madi) 🤍 - a junior at UIUC studying information sciences & HCI.

### lil more about me 🤭
Currently, I'm a UI/UX design intern at Synchrony exploring atomic design & prototyping. I was previously a UI/UX design intern at Cargill designing for AI chatbot interactions, and a product designer at Hack4Impact creating technology for nonprofits.

### If it looks like I'm spacing out... 🌌
In my free time I thrift with friends and my fashion RSO STYL 👖. I cafe hop and struggle to find the WIFI password ☕. I design sticker and packaging for fake products for funzies 🧃. Wake up at 7am for a morning workout 🏃🏻💨.
But in my personal work and interests, I love exploring the concept of identity, memories, digital presence, and social interactions. I like to mix this with popular aesthic/design trends for social commentary.
