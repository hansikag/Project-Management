# Hi, my name is Austin Clark

### Hello and welcome to my page, I am a senior here and I'm from Evanston Illinois

I have been an information science major since sophomore year after hoping around majors my freshman year.

#### Some hobbies of mine: 

Activity | Description |
------|------|
Bowling | I enjoy bowling with my Dad and friends during the summer. |
Music | I grew up in a music family so I love finding new songs and discovering artists. |
Bar and Restaurant trying | Being from Evanston, Chicago is only a 20 minute drive so we enjoy trying new foods and checking out new bars with pool and darts. |

I look forward to working you all
