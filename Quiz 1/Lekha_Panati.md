<h1>Hi, my name is Lekha!</h1>

I'm a sophomore at UIUC, and I was born and raised in Colorado. I have an older sister who lives in New York who inspired me to pursue 
Information Science and Data Science. I love to travel, collect vinyl records, and listen to music. Below are a few of my favorite music artists, and my favorite songs and albums by them.

| Artist | Favorite Song | Favorite Album
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Taylor Swift  | peace    | folklore |
| Lana Del Rey | West Coast | Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd |
| Phoebe Bridgers    | I Know the End | Punisher | 
| TV Girl | Lovers Rock | French Exit |

I've been to a few concerts as well! I am so lucky to have seen Taylor Swift, Phoebe Bridgers, and TV Girl in person, and hope to see Lana Del Rey soon. Below is an image
of my friends and me before the Taylor Swift Eras Tour in Denver.
